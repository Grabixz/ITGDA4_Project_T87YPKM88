BELOW GIVES MORE EXPLANATION OF EACH QUESTION AND HOW EXACTLY THE KEYS AND CONTROLS WORK
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question One:
The following shapes were hard coded. It was a cube, triangular pyramid, and triangular prism.
Their vertices were declared and were connected using their edges. On each file for their shapes,
it explains which vertex and edges is declared for which face of the shape.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question Two:
To be able to switch between the three shapes, a control was added to switch between them.
The control to switch between them is THE KEYBOARD SPACE BAR.
When the program first runs, the first shape that will display will be the Cube. When you press the
space bar, it will switch to the next shape which will be the triangular pyramid. When you press
the space bar again, it will go to the triangular prism. When pressed again, it will display the
cube. It will loop between these three shapes each time you press the space bar.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question Three:
To be able to translate the object that is being displayed, the following controls work as follows:
To move the object up, PRESS THE UP ARROW KEY. To move the object down, PRESS THE DOWN ARROW KEY.
To move the object left, PRESS THE LEFT ARROW KEY. To move the object right, PRESS THE RIGHT ARROW KEY.
After the object has been moved to a certain position, and you change the object to be displayed,
the position of the object will remain the same.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question Four:
To be able to rotate the object that is being displayed, the following controls work as follows:
To rotate the object on the positive x-axis, PRESS THE W KEY. To rotate the object on the negative
x-axis, PRESS THE S KEY. To rotate the object on the positive y-axis, PRESS THE A KEY. To rotate the
object on the negative y-axis, PRESS THE D KEY. To rotate the object on the positive z-axis, PRESS
THE Q KEY. To rotate the object on the negative z-axis, PRESS THE E KEY. After the object that has
been rotated at a certain angle, and you press the SPACE BAR key, the next object will be at that
certain rotation as the previous object.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question Five:
To be able to scale the object that is currently being displayed on the screen, you should press the
following keys: To shrink the object on the x-axis, PRESS THE R KEY. To grow the object on the x-axis,
PRESS THE F KEY. To shrink the object on the y-axis, PRESS THE T KEY. To grow the object on the y-axis,
PRESS THE G KEY. To shrink the object on the z-axis, PRESS THE Y KEY. To grow the object on the z-axis,
PRESS THE H KEY. If you change the object shape by pressing the SPACE BAR key, the scale will stay the
same as you set it for the previous shape before you changed it.
